# COB LED Strips: Power Consumption and Where to Actually Use Them

Hey, Daniel here!

So I've been planning the LED lighting for a villa project and went down a rabbit hole figuring out power consumption. Every supplier quotes different numbers, the specs are confusing, and nobody tells you which strip type to actually use where.

Spent way too much time on this. here's what I found.

## Why 24V COB Strips?

Quick background for anyone new to this. COB means Chip-On-Board - basically tons of tiny LEDs packed together under a phosphor layer. The result is a continuous line of light instead of visible dots.

Why 24V instead of 12V?
- Less voltage drop over distance
- Can run longer strips without dimming at the end
- Better for architectural lighting where you need 5-10 meter runs

The dotless look is what makes COB strips worth the extra cost. Regular SMD strips show individual LED points which looks cheap in a nice house.

## Power Consumption Per Meter

ok here's the actual data. This is what I found across different suppliers:

### White COB Strips (24V)

| Type | Power (W/m) | Lumens/m | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Low output | 8-10 W/m | ~800-1000 lm/m | Accent lighting, mood |
| Medium output | 10-15 W/m | ~1100-1400 lm/m | General decorative |
| High output | 15-20 W/m | ~1600+ lm/m | Functional lighting |

Most villa projects use 10-12 W/m strips. That's enough for cove lighting and most decorative stuff without going crazy on power consumption.

For reference, a 5 meter strip at 15 W/m = 75 watts total. Not terrible but it adds up when you have strips everywhere.

### RGB COB Strips (24V)

RGB is a bit more complicated because power depends on what color you're running:

- Single color (red, green, or blue): ~4-5 W/m per channel
- Full white (all three on): ~12-15 W/m
- RGBW strips (with dedicated white): up to 20 W/m when everything's maxed

Most of the time you're not running full blast. Dimmed to 50-70% is more realistic for daily use, which cuts consumption significantly.

One thing people don't realize - RGB "white" looks kinda bad compared to actual white LEDs. If you want good white light AND color options, go RGBW even though it costs more.

## Interior Use Cases

Right, so where do you actually put these things?

### Cove Lighting

This is the classic. Hide strips in ceiling recesses or crown molding, light bounces off the ceiling for indirect ambient glow.

What works:
- Warm white (2700-3000K) for living areas and bedrooms
- 10-12 W/m is usually enough
- High CRI (90+) so your furniture colors look right
- Dimmable obviously

The trick is hiding the strip completely. You should see the glow, not the source. Most people mount them too close to the edge and you can see the strip itself. Not a good look.

### Staircase Lighting

Under-step lighting or along the handrail. Both functional and decorative.

Specs that work:
- Lower power, like 5-10 W/m (you dont need bright stairs)
- Warm white for residential
- Motion sensor activation is worth the extra hassle
- Aluminum channels with diffusers protect the strip and look cleaner

COB strips are actually perfect for stairs because the no-dots thing. Regular LED strips on stairs look terrible - you see each individual light point reflecting off the step surface.

### Under Cabinet / Kitchen

For task lighting under kitchen cabinets:
- Higher output, maybe 12-15 W/m since you actually need to see what you're cooking
- Neutral white (4000K) works better than warm for food prep
- Water resistant coating if near sink
- Diffuser channel to avoid harsh spots

### Accent Lighting

Shelves, artwork, architectural details. Here you want subtle:
- 8-10 W/m max
- Usually warm white
- Dimmed most of the time
- Hidden mounting is everything

## Exterior Use Cases

Outdoor is trickier because weatherproofing matters a lot.

### Facade Lighting

Strips tucked under eaves, along rooflines, or outlining architectural features.

Requirements:
- IP65 minimum, IP67 preferred
- UV-resistant silicone coating (regular ones yellow in sunlight)
- Higher power (15 W/m) since you're lighting bigger surfaces
- Warm or neutral white for classy look, RGB for special occasions

The goal is washing walls or highlighting textures. Hide the strip, show the effect.

### Pathway and Landscape

Along walkways, garden edges, deck perimeters.

What I'm planning:
- IP67 rated (will get wet)
- Warm white (3000K) for inviting feel
- ~10 W/m - paths dont need to be super bright
- Recessed aluminum channels at ground level
- Timer or motion control to save power

COB strips work well here because the continuous light creates smooth guide lines instead of dotted patterns on the ground.

### Pool Area

This needs IP68 if anywhere near water. The extra waterproofing costs more but worth it vs replacing corroded strips.

Warm white around the pool deck. Maybe RGB for the pool house or entertainment area.

## Power Supply Sizing

Quick math for planning your power supply:

1. Calculate total strip length (meters)
2. Multiply by W/m rating
3. Add 20% headroom (don't run at 100% capacity)

Example:
- Living room cove: 12m at 12 W/m = 144W
- Stairs: 6m at 8 W/m = 48W
- Kitchen under cabinet: 4m at 14 W/m = 56W
- Total: 248W
- With 20% margin: 300W power supply

For longer runs, check voltage drop. 24V strips can usually do 5-10m before dimming at the far end. Longer than that? Feed from both ends or use multiple runs.

## Optimization Tips

Things I learned the hard way (or from others who did):

### Energy Efficiency

- Dim everything. Running at 70% brightness uses way less power and LEDs last longer
- Zone your circuits so you can turn off areas you're not using
- Motion sensors for functional lighting (stairs, paths)
- Timers for exterior - no point lighting your facade at 3am

### Durability

- Aluminum channels are not optional. They dissipate heat and protect the strip
- Outdoor: make sure the IP rating matches your environment
- Don't cheap out on power supplies - bad ones kill strips fast
- Check run length limits before buying

### Visual Quality

- CRI 90+ for interiors. Lower CRI makes everything look washed out
- Match color temps throughout connected spaces (mixing 3000K and 5000K in the same room looks weird)
- Always use diffusers in visible locations
- Hide the strip, show the light

## What I'm Actually Using

For my project in Cebu:

**Interior:**
- Cove lighting: 24V COB white, 12 W/m, 3000K, CRI 90+
- Stairs: 24V COB white, 8 W/m, 3000K, with motion sensors
- Kitchen: 24V COB white, 14 W/m, 4000K

**Exterior:**
- Facade: 24V COB white, 15 W/m, IP65, 3000K
- Pathways: 24V COB white, 10 W/m, IP67, 3000K
- Pool deck: RGBW option for flexibility, IP68

Total estimated power draw for all strips at 100%: around 800W. Realistically at normal dimmed levels, probably 400-500W when everything's on. Not crazy but not nothing either.

## Suppliers Note

I haven't found great local Philippine suppliers for quality COB strips yet. Most hardware stores stock the cheap stuff. Alibaba has better options but minimum orders are annoying for residential projects.

If anyone has good local sources let me know. Otherwise plan for shipping time from China.

## Quick Reference Table

| Location | Power | Color Temp | IP Rating | Notes |
|----------|-------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Cove lighting | 10-12 W/m | 2700-3000K | IP20 | Dimmer required |
| Stairs | 5-10 W/m | 3000K | IP20/IP65 | Motion sensor |
| Kitchen task | 12-15 W/m | 4000K | IP20/IP65 | Under cabinet |
| Facade | 15+ W/m | 3000K | IP65+ | UV resistant |
| Pathway | 10 W/m | 3000K | IP67 | Ground level |
| Pool area | varies | varies | IP68 | Submersible rated |

anyway that's my research. Power consumption numbers are approximate - always check actual specs from your supplier. And budget for more strips than you think you need, everyone ends up adding more.
