## Calcification on Floor Tiles

When I first spotted those chalky white stains creeping across my floor tiles, courtesy of my indoor plants, I knew I had a new household challenge. Living here in the Philippines, with our unique climate and hard water, calcification on tiles isn't just an eyesore—it's a common nuisance many of us face.

### Prevention

1. **Purified Water**: I thought, "Water is just water, right?" Turns out, switching to distilled or filtered water for my plants significantly reduced mineral deposits. It’s a small change that made a big difference.

2. **Water Elsewhere**: I started watering my plants in the sink or outside. Letting them drain fully before bringing them back indoors meant less excess water seeping onto my tiles.

3. **Saucers Under Pots**: Placing saucers or trays under each pot became a game-changer. It caught the runoff and kept my floors dry. Simple, yet effective.

4. **Seal the Tiles**: Applying a sealant gave my floor tiles an extra layer of protection. It's like giving them a shield against future mineral buildup.

### Removal

1. **Vinegar Solution**: Remembering an old tip from my grandmother, I soaked a cloth in white vinegar and left it on the stained areas overnight. The next morning, the acidity had broken down the calcium deposits remarkably well.

2. **Specialized Cleaners**: For tougher spots, I turned to commercial products designed to tackle calcium, lime, and rust. Following the instructions carefully, they proved to be quite effective.

3. **Gentle Scrubbing**: Using a pumice stone gently helped remove stubborn deposits without scratching the tiles. It required a bit of elbow grease, but the results were worth it.

4. **Acid-Based Cleaners**: As a last resort, I tried a stronger acid-based cleaner on a hidden area first. Once I was confident it wouldn't damage the tiles, I proceeded cautiously.

5. **Combine Methods**: Sometimes, a combination did the trick. Applying the vinegar solution overnight and then gently scrubbing in the morning tackled the most persistent stains.

### Tips

1. **Stay Proactive**: Wiping up spills immediately prevented minerals from setting in. It’s easier to prevent than to cure.

2. **Improve Water Quality**: Considering a water softener or filtration system can reduce minerals at the source, benefiting not just your floors but appliances too.

3. **Smart Plant Placement**: Moving plants to areas less susceptible to water damage minimized the risk. Sometimes, a little rearrangement helps.

4. **Alternative Watering**: Exploring self-watering pots or drip systems reduced spills and kept both my plants and floors happier.

Always remember to test any cleaning method on a small, inconspicuous area first. If you're unsure, it's wise to consult a professional. Maintaining our homes here in the Philippines comes with its set of challenges, but with a bit of knowledge and effort, we can keep them looking their best.
