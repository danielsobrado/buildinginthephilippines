## 2. Basic Principles

### 2.1 Minimum Footing Depth

1. Minimum footing depth: 1 meter below ground level
   - Purpose: To reach stable soil below the frost line and organic topsoil
   - Considerations: 
     - Increase depth in areas with deep frost penetration or expansive soils
     - In coastal areas, consider scour depth due to wave action

2. Reinforced concrete strength: Minimum 20.7 MPa (3000 psi)
   - Purpose: To ensure durability and load-bearing capacity
   - Considerations:
     - Increase to 30 MPa (4350 psi) or higher for marine environments
     - Use sulfate-resistant cement in areas with high sulfate content in soil or water
   - Testing: Conduct regular cylinder tests to verify strength

3. Steel reinforcement: Grade 40 (280 MPa) or Grade 60 (420 MPa)
   - Purpose: To provide tensile strength and control cracking
   - Considerations:
     - Use Grade 60 for higher strength and potentially reduced steel quantity
     - In coastal areas, use epoxy-coated or stainless steel rebar to prevent corrosion
   - Placement: Ensure proper concrete cover (minimum 75mm for foundations)

4. Soil bearing capacity:
   - Conduct thorough geotechnical investigation to determine allowable bearing pressure
   - Design foundation size based on calculated loads and allowable soil pressure
   - Factor of safety: Use minimum 3.0 for bearing capacity calculations

5. Waterproofing:
   - Apply waterproofing membranes to all below-grade concrete surfaces
   - Install drainage systems around foundations to divert water

6. Seismic considerations:
   - Design foundations to resist lateral loads from earthquakes
   - Incorporate tie beams to connect individual footings for better load distribution

## 2. Foundation Types

### 2.1 Shallow Foundations

1. Strip footings:
   - Use: For load-bearing walls
   - Design: Continuous reinforced concrete footing under walls
   - Advantages: Simple to construct, economical for light loads
   - Considerations: 
     - Width based on wall load and soil bearing capacity
     - Typically 2-3 times wider than the wall above

2. Isolated footings:
   - Use: For individual columns
   - Design: Square or rectangular pad of reinforced concrete
   - Advantages: Efficient use of materials, easy to construct
   - Considerations:
     - Size based on column load and soil bearing capacity
     - May require tie beams in seismic zones

3. Raft foundations:
   - Use: For poor soil conditions or heavy loads
   - Design: Reinforced concrete slab under entire building footprint
   - Advantages: Distributes load evenly, reduces differential settlement
   - Considerations:
     - Requires more concrete than other shallow foundations
     - May incorporate ground beams for added stiffness

### 2.2 Deep Foundations

1. Pile foundations:
   - Use: For weak upper soil layers
   - Types:
     a. Driven piles: Precast concrete, steel, or timber driven into the ground
     b. Bored piles: Cast-in-place concrete piles
     c. Screw piles: Steel shafts with helical plates
   - Advantages: Can reach deep bearing layers, resist uplift forces
   - Considerations:
     - Choose type based on soil conditions, load requirements, and site constraints
     - Consider noise and vibration during installation for driven piles

2. Caisson foundations:
   - Use: For very heavy loads or deep bedrock
   - Types:
     a. Drilled shafts: Large diameter bored piles
     b. Pneumatic caissons: Pressurized chambers for underwater construction
   - Advantages: Can handle extremely high loads, suitable for difficult soil conditions
   - Considerations:
     - Require specialized equipment and expertise
     - Often used for bridges, high-rise buildings, and marine structures

3. Combined foundations:
   - Use: For varying soil conditions or complex structural requirements
   - Examples:
     a. Piled raft: Combines raft foundation with piles for added support
     b. Pile groups with caps: Multiple piles connected by a reinforced concrete cap
   - Advantages: Combines benefits of different foundation types
   - Considerations:
     - More complex design and construction
     - Allows for optimization of foundation performance and cost

When selecting a foundation type, consider:
- Soil conditions and bearing capacity
- Structural loads (vertical, lateral, and uplift)
- Site constraints and accessibility
- Local construction practices and available equipment
- Cost and schedule implications
- Long-term performance and maintenance requirements

## 3. Materials and Techniques

### 3.1 Formwork
- Use water-resistant plywood or steel forms
- Ensure proper bracing to prevent displacement during concrete pouring
- Apply form release agent for easy removal

### 3.2 Concrete Mix
- Use sulfate-resistant cement for coastal areas
- Water-cement ratio: 0.45-0.50
- Include waterproofing admixtures for improved durability

### 3.3 Reinforcement
- Minimum cover for reinforcement: 75mm for foundations exposed to earth
- Use epoxy-coated or galvanized rebar in highly corrosive environments

### 3.4 Insulation
- Extruded polystyrene (XPS) boards: Place on the exterior of foundation walls
- Thickness: 50-100mm depending on thermal requirements

### 3.5 Waterproofing
- Apply bituminous waterproofing membrane on exterior foundation walls
- Install perforated drainage pipes around the foundation perimeter

### 3.6 Windows
Research from Typhoon Haiyan reveals that jalousie windows represent severe vulnerability, with academic studies identifying them as major structural weaknesses.

## 4. Foundations for Limestone Soil

### 4.1 Characteristics of Limestone Soil
- Highly permeable
- Potential for sinkholes and cavities
- Variable load-bearing capacity

### 4.2 Site Investigation
- Conduct thorough geotechnical surveys, including:
  - Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)
  - Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI)
  - Core drilling and sampling

### 4.3 Foundation Design for Limestone
- Avoid shallow foundations if possible
- Prefer deep foundations that transfer loads to competent bedrock
- Consider ground improvement techniques:
  - Grouting to fill voids
  - Soil mixing to improve bearing capacity

### 4.4 Specific Foundation Types for Limestone
- Pile foundations:
  - Use driven piles with caution due to potential for sudden drops
  - Prefer bored piles or continuous flight auger (CFA) piles
- Mat foundations:
  - Use for moderate loads and where bedrock is within reasonable depth
  - Incorporate grade beams to distribute loads evenly

### 4.5 Additional Precautions
- Design for potential sinkhole formation:
  - Incorporate structural slabs that can span potential voids
  - Use geotextiles to prevent soil migration into cavities
- Implement robust drainage systems to prevent water accumulation
- Monitor foundation performance regularly for signs of settlement or sinkholes

## 5. Quality Control and Inspection

- Conduct regular soil tests during excavation
- Perform slump tests and concrete cylinder tests for each pour
- Inspect reinforcement placement before concrete pouring
- Conduct post-construction integrity tests (e.g., pile integrity testing)

Remember to adapt these guidelines to specific site conditions and local regulations. Always consult with a licensed structural engineer and geotechnical expert for final design and implementation.
