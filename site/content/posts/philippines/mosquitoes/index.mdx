# Mosquito-Resistant Construction Techniques

## 1. Site Planning

- **Drainage:** Ensure proper site drainage to eliminate standing water
- **Landscaping:** 
  - Avoid plants that collect water in leaves or flowers
  - Maintain grass and shrubs at low heights
  - Use mosquito-repelling plants like citronella, marigolds, and lavender

## 2. Building Design

### 2.1 Openings
- **Windows:** 
  - Install tight-fitting screens (16-18 mesh)
  - Use self-closing mechanisms
- **Doors:**
  - Use self-closing, tight-fitting doors
  - Install door sweeps to seal gaps

### 2.2 Ventilation
- **Roof Ventilation:** 
  - Use screened soffit vents
  - Install ridge vents with fine mesh
- **Wall Vents:** 
  - Cover all wall vents with fine mesh screens

### 2.3 Overhangs and Eaves
- Design overhangs to minimize areas where mosquitoes can rest
- Use materials that don't retain heat (mosquitoes are attracted to warmth)

## 3. Material Selection

- **Exterior Walls:** 
  - Use smooth materials that don't provide resting spots
  - Consider light-colored finishes (mosquitoes are attracted to dark colors)
- **Screens:** 
  - Use durable materials like aluminum or stainless steel
  - For areas with smaller insects, consider using 20-mesh screens

## 4. Water Management

- **Gutters:** 
  - Design to prevent water accumulation
  - Use gutter guards to prevent debris buildup
- **Air Conditioning Units:** 
  - Ensure proper drainage for condensate
- **Water Features:** 
  - If included, use fountains or moving water (mosquitoes prefer still water)
  - Stock ornamental ponds with mosquito-eating fish

## 5. Lighting

- Use LED or sodium lights instead of mercury vapor lights
- Position necessary outdoor lighting away from doors and windows
- Consider motion-sensor lights to reduce constant illumination

## 6. Screening Systems

- **Screened Enclosures:** 
  - For patios, porches, or entire yards
  - Use fine mesh screening (20-mesh or finer)
- **Retractable Screens:** 
  - For large openings or indoor-outdoor spaces

## 7. Maintenance Considerations

- Design easy access for gutter cleaning
- Use durable, weather-resistant materials for screens and seals
- Plan for regular inspection and maintenance of potential mosquito breeding sites

## 8. Additional Technologies

- **Mosquito Misting Systems:** 
  - Integrated systems that release mosquito repellent at set intervals
- **Fans:** 
  - Incorporate ceiling fans in outdoor areas (mosquitoes are weak fliers)

## 9. Community Planning

- Work with neighbors and local authorities on area-wide mosquito control
- Consider community-wide drainage solutions and mosquito management programs
