# Typhoon-Resistant Roof Design: One-Sided Roofs

## 1. One-Sided Roof Characteristics

- Also known as: Mono-pitch, shed roof, or skillion roof
- Description: Single sloping plane, usually with a steep pitch
- Common uses: Modern architectural designs, additions to existing structures

## 2. Typhoon Resistance Considerations

### 2.1 Advantages
- Simple design with fewer seams, reducing potential water entry points
- Can be designed with a steep pitch for effective water shedding
- Fewer edges for wind to catch compared to more complex roof shapes

### 2.2 Challenges
- Large surface area can experience significant uplift forces in high winds
- Asymmetrical design may lead to uneven wind loads on the structure
- Potential for increased wind-driven rain penetration on the high wall

## 3. Design Recommendations for Typhoon Resistance

### 3.1 Pitch and Orientation
- Optimal pitch: 30-45 degrees
- Orient the low end towards the prevailing wind direction if possible

### 3.2 Structural Reinforcement
- Use hurricane straps to secure roof to walls
- Implement robust roof-to-wall connections, especially at the high wall
- Consider using a structural ridge beam for added strength

### 3.3 Roofing Materials
- Use impact-resistant materials (e.g., metal roofing, concrete tiles)
- Ensure proper overlap and fastening of roofing materials
- Install a fully-adhered underlayment for additional water resistance

### 3.4 Overhang and Edges
- Minimize roof overhangs (ideally less than 50 cms/20 inches)
- Use aerodynamic edge details to reduce wind uplift

### 3.5 Ventilation
- Implement pressure-equalized soffit vents
- Consider ridge venting systems designed for high-wind areas

### 3.6 Water Management
- Install larger gutters and downspouts to handle heavy rainfall
- Use multiple downspouts to distribute water flow

## 4. Additional Considerations

- Ensure compliance with local building codes for high-wind areas
- Conduct wind tunnel testing or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis for complex designs
- Consider the entire building envelope in the design, not just the roof
- Regular maintenance and inspections are crucial for long-term performance

## 5. Alternative Roof Designs for Comparison

- Hip roof: Generally considered more typhoon-resistant due to its sloped sides
- Gable roof with low pitch: Can be vulnerable to uplift in high winds
- Flat roof: Can be designed for high-wind resistance but requires careful detailing for water management
