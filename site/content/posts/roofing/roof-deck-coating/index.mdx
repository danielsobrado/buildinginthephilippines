## Your Waterproofing Coating Options

### 1. Epoxy Systems: The Heavy-Duty Option

**The Good Stuff:**
- Tough as nails when properly installed
- Chemical resistant (great for areas with pollution concerns)
- Smooth finish that's easy to clean

**The Reality Check:**
- Mid range cost
- Needs anti-slip additives or you're building a slip-n-slide
- That UV protection isn't optional – it's crucial
- High humidity? Your curing time just got complicated

> If you're going epoxy, schedule installation during the dry season.

### 2. **Polyurethane**: The Smart Money Choice

**Why It Works:**
- Easiest on the wallet
- Handles our tropical weather like a champ
- Already got grip built in
- Moves with your building (crucial for those thermal expansions)

**Installation Notes:**
- Less fussy about humidity
- More forgiving if your applicator isn't perfect
- Maintenance won't break the bank

> Best bang for buck in our climate.

### 3. PVC Membrane: The Premium Play

**The Premium Package:**
- Most expensive
- Factory-controlled quality (no on-site variables)
- Serious warranties (10-15 years if installed right)

**The Catch:**
- Limited supplier options locally
- Need specialized installation teams
- Import-dependent pricing (watch that exchange rate)
