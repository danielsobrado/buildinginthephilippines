# Cabinet Hinges That Won't Rust 150 Meters From the Sea

Hey, Daniel here!

So I'm speccing out kitchen and cabinet hardware for a villa in Cebu. 150 meters from the sea. Every contractor here recommends Blum because that's what everyone uses. "Blum is the best" they say.

And Blum IS good. But here's the thing nobody mentions: standard Blum hinges are nickel-plated steel. They're not stainless. And Blum themselves say their hinges are "not recommended for outdoor applications."

150 meters from salt water? That's basically outdoor conditions for your hardware.

## The Problem with Standard Cabinet Hardware

Most cabinet hinges, even the expensive ones, are steel with nickel or zinc plating. In a normal inland kitchen? Fine. Works great for 20+ years.

Near the coast? Different story.

Salt air gets everywhere. Inside cabinets, under sinks, anywhere with humidity. The plating eventually fails and steel underneath starts rusting. I've seen 3-year-old Blum hinges in coastal homes with rust spots already.

## What Actually Resists Salt

Quick materials lesson (I had to learn this the hard way):

**304 Stainless Steel (SS304)**
- Good corrosion resistance
- Works for most coastal indoor applications
- Not as good as 316 but way better than plated steel

**316 Stainless Steel (SS316)**
- "Marine grade" - contains molybdenum for extra salt resistance
- What boats use
- More expensive but basically rust-proof near the sea

**Nickel-plated steel (what most hinges are)**
- Looks like stainless
- Is NOT stainless
- Will rust in coastal environments eventually

The problem is most hardware stores in Cebu sell plated steel and call it "stainless finish." Not the same thing at all.

## Blum's BCOR Coating

ok so Blum does offer something for humid environments. It's called BCOR (Blum Corrosion) coating. This is a special galvanic coating they put on hinges for kitchens and bathrooms.

The specs:
- Passed 48 hour neutral salt spray test (ISO 9227)
- Passed 24 hour acetic acid salt spray test
- Better than standard nickel plating

Is it enough for 150m from the sea? Maybe for indoor cabinets. Probably not for anything with direct moisture exposure or outdoor kitchens.

Here's the thing - 48 hours salt spray sounds good until you realize true marine-grade 316 SS hardware gets tested to 500+ hours. Big difference.

## Better Options I Found

After a lot of research, here's what actually works for coastal villas:

### Hettich Veosys (Germany)

This is the one I'm probably going with for most cabinets.

Specs:
- Full 304 stainless steel construction
- 120 hour salt spray tested (ISO 9227)
- Built-in soft close
- 105 degree opening
- Fits standard 35mm cup boring

Hettich markets this specifically for "outdoor or coastal use" which is exactly what I need. Not cheap but not crazy expensive either.

### Sugatsune 180SUS Series (Japan)

Japanese brand, really well made. Their 180SUS-C46-19T model:
- 304 stainless steel body
- 500 hour salt spray rating (wow)
- Soft close damper in resin casing (protects from corrosion)
- 30,000 cycle life test
- Standard 35mm cup

They also have a 304B-46/19 that passed 480h salt spray if you don't need soft close.

Sugatsune explicitly says these are "ideal for cabinets, outdoor and commercial kitchens... for outdoor use." Good enough for me.

### Hafele 316 SS Hinges (Germany)

If you want actual 316 marine grade:
- Model 344.75.051 is full AISI 316 stainless
- 720 hour salt spray rating
- Self-closing spring mechanism
- Originally designed for institutional/marine use

This is overkill for indoor cabinets but perfect for outdoor kitchen, pool house, or anything directly exposed to salt spray.

## Chinese Alternatives

Blum is expensive. The European brands above are also expensive. What about importing from China?

There ARE legitimate 304 and 316 stainless hinges from Chinese manufacturers. I researched a bunch:

**NISKO** - Makes SUS304 hinges with claimed 168 hour salt spray rating. Their SA06-A model has soft close and 100,000+ cycle rating. Way cheaper than European brands.

**D&D Hardware** - Makes SS316 concealed hinges with EN1935 certification (200,000 cycles). More industrial looking but legitimate marine grade.

**Xinxing Marine** - Full 316 SS hinges made for boats. Not pretty but literally designed for salt water.

### Are Chinese Hinges as Good as Blum?

Honest answer: some are close, some aren't.

**Where they match:**
- Material quality (if you verify it's actually 304/316)
- Salt spray resistance (often better because it's real stainless)
- Cycle life on paper

**Where Blum wins:**
- Consistency - every Blum hinge feels exactly the same
- Soft close smoothness - still the gold standard
- Fit and finish details
- Long term reliability track record

My take: for a seafront villa where corrosion is the main concern, a real 304 or 316 SS Chinese hinge will probably outlast a plated Blum hinge. But it might not feel quite as nice.

## What I'm Actually Specifying

For my project, here's what I'm doing:

**Main kitchen cabinets (indoor):**
- Hettich Veosys or Sugatsune 180SUS
- 304 SS is enough for indoor with AC
- Soft close required

**Under sink and wet areas:**
- 316 SS slides (Hafele or Chinese import)
- 316 SS hinges where possible
- These areas get constant moisture

**Outdoor kitchen / pool house:**
- Full 316 SS everything
- Xinxing Marine or similar boat hardware
- Accept the more industrial look

**Drawer slides:**
- 316L stainless in wet zones
- Regular quality elsewhere but verify actual stainless

**Pulls and knobs:**
- 316 SS throughout - cheap and why not
- Avoids mismatched oxidation

## How to Verify Stainless Grade

This is important because sellers lie.

**Quick tests:**
- Magnet test: 304/316 is weakly magnetic or non-magnetic. Regular steel is strongly magnetic. Not perfect but catches the worst fakes.
- Molybdenum test kits: Confirms 316 vs 304 (316 has molybdenum, 304 doesn't)
- Mill certificates: Ask for material certification from supplier

**Red flags:**
- "Stainless finish" instead of "stainless steel"
- Price too good to be true for 316
- No specs on actual material grade
- Vague descriptions like "rust resistant"

## Cost Comparison

Rough numbers from my research (prices vary a lot):

| Hardware | Blum Standard | Blum BCOR | Hettich Veosys | Chinese 304 SS |
|----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Hinge (per piece) | ~$4-6 | ~$6-8 | ~$8-12 | ~$2-4 |
| Drawer slide (pair) | ~$15-25 | N/A | ~$20-30 | ~$8-15 |

The premium for true stainless is maybe 50-100% more than standard. But replacing rusted hardware in 5 years costs way more than that.

## Questions to Ask Suppliers

Copy paste this when you're buying:

1. What is the exact material grade? (should be specific like SUS304 or AISI 316, not "stainless")
2. Do you have ASTM B117 or ISO 9227 salt spray test results? How many hours?
3. Is the entire hinge stainless or just certain parts?
4. Do you have material certification / mill cert?
5. What's your warranty for coastal environments?

If they can't answer these clearly, find another supplier.

## The Bottom Line

Standard Blum hinges are great hardware but they're plated steel, not stainless. For a villa near the sea in the Philippines, that's a problem.

Options:
1. **Blum with BCOR coating** - decent for indoor, probably okay for most applications
2. **Hettich Veosys or Sugatsune** - true 304 SS, better salt spray ratings, what I'd recommend for coastal
3. **316 SS hinges** - for outdoor kitchen, wet zones, or if you want zero worry
4. **Chinese 304/316 SS** - cost effective if you verify the material is real

The extra cost for proper marine-grade hardware is small compared to the total cabinet cost. And definitely cheaper than replacing everything when it rusts.

Don't let a contractor talk you into standard hardware just because "everyone uses Blum." Near the sea, material grade matters more than brand name.

anyway that's what I learned. Still waiting on quotes from a few suppliers. Will update if I find better options.
