# Complete Guide to Buying Aluminum Windows and Doors from Chinese Suppliers

Chinese suppliers offer quality aluminum windows and doors at competitive prices, but the buying process requires specific knowledge to avoid mistakes. 

## Understanding Aluminum Alloys for Philippine Conditions

### Why 6063-T5 is the Philippine Standard

**6063-T5 aluminum** is the most common specification for windows and doors for the Philippines because:
- **Corrosion resistance**: Essential for coastal areas and high humidity
- **Strength-to-weight ratio**: Handles typhoon loads without excessive weight
- **Extrusion compatibility**: Easy to form complex profiles
- **Cost effectiveness**: Good performance without premium pricing

### Typhoon and Rust Protection Essentials

**Minimum Requirements:**
- **Alloy**: 6063-T5 aluminum minimum
- **Wall thickness**: 1.5mm minimum for windows, 2.0mm+ for doors  
- **Thermal break**: Essential for energy efficiency and condensation control
- **Proper drainage**: Built-in weep holes for water management

**Upgrade Options:**
- **6061-T6 aluminum**: Higher strength for extreme wind loads
- **Increased wall thickness**: 2.0mm+ for enhanced typhoon resistance
- **Marine-grade hardware**: Stainless steel components for coastal areas

## Aluminum Series Explained

### Standard vs Premium Series

**125-70 Series (Basic)**
- Wall thickness: 1.5mm
- Thermal break: Yes
- Best for: Standard residential applications
- Price range: Most economical

**110 Ultra-Narrow Series (Premium)**
- Wall thickness: 1.8mm
- Thermal break: Enhanced
- Benefits: Maximum glass area, modern aesthetics
- Price premium: 15-20% over standard

**116-76 Heavy-Duty Series (Doors)**
- Wall thickness: 2.5mm
- Thermal break: Industrial grade
- Best for: Large sliding doors, high-traffic areas
- Applications: Main entrances, large openings

### Key Questions for Suppliers

1. **"What is the wall thickness of your aluminum profiles?"**
2. **"Is this 6063-T5 aluminum with thermal break?"**
3. **"What is the frame visibility width?"** (Ultra-narrow vs standard)
4. **"Can you provide structural load calculations for typhoon resistance?"**

## Glass Specifications That Matter

### Triple Glazing Standard Configuration

**Minimum Spec for Philippines:**
- **5mm clear glass + 1.14PVB + 5mm clear glass + 12A Argon + 5mm LOW-E**
- Total thickness: ~27mm
- Performance: Energy efficient, impact resistant, noise reduction

**Configuration Variables:**
- **PVB thickness**: 0.76mm (basic) vs 1.14mm (premium safety)
- **Spacer width**: 12A, 19A, 20A, 25A (higher = better insulation)
- **LOW-E position**: Outside pane for energy efficiency
- **Glass type**: Clear, tinted, or reflective options

### Cost Impact of Glass Upgrades

- **Basic to premium PVB**: +$15-25 per sqm
- **Standard to wide spacer**: +$10-20 per sqm
- **Adding LOW-E coating**: +$20-30 per sqm (mandatory recommendation)
- **Tinted/reflective glass**: +$25-40 per sqm (Not required is you use laminated glass)

Don’t pay for deep “colored/low-UV” glass just to protect from UV. In the Philippines, you’ll get better comfort + durability by using neutral solar-control Low-E + laminated glass. Tints are optional for glare. Laminated blocks >99% UV, protects furniture/finishes, adds security.

### Essential Questions

1. **"What is your standard glass configuration?"**
2. **"Is LOW-E coating included in the price?"**
3. **"What PVB thickness do you use?"**
4. **"Can you provide thermal performance data?"**

## Hardware Quality Tiers

### Brand Hierarchy (Chinese Market)

**Tier 1: Premium Brands**
- **HOPO**: Heavy-duty sliding systems
- **KINLONG**: Premium residential hardware
- Price premium: 30-50% over basic

**Tier 2: Standard Brands**
- Various established Chinese manufacturers
- Good quality-to-price ratio
- Suitable for most residential applications

**Tier 3: Basic/Generic**
- Often just labeled "China Brand"
- Functional but limited durability
- Cost savings: 20-40% less than premium

### Hardware by Window Type

**Sliding Windows:**
- Track system quality determines operation smoothness
- Ball bearing rollers vs plastic wheels
- Stainless steel vs aluminum tracks

**Awning/Casement Windows:**
- Hinge quality affects weight capacity
- Multi-point locking for security
- Weather sealing integration

**Sliding Doors:**
- Heavy-duty track systems required
- High-quality rollers for large panel weight
- Security locking mechanisms

## Surface Protection Options

### Coating Types for Philippine Climate

**Powder Coating (Standard)**
- Process: Electrostatic spray, oven-cured
- Durability: 10-15 years typical

- Best for: Coastal areas, high sun exposure

**Anodizing (Specialty)**
- Process: Electrochemical oxidation
- Durability: Permanent color integration
- Colors: Limited to metallic tones
- Cost: Similar to fluorocarbon
- Best for: Architectural applications

### Color Selection Strategy

**Standard Colors (No Premium):**
- White, black, gray, bronze
- Usually powder coating sufficient

**Custom/Premium Colors:**

## The Bottom Line

Chinese suppliers offer excellent value for aluminum windows and doors, but success requires preparation and specific technical knowledge.

**Essential Requirements:**
1. **6063-T5 aluminum minimum** with appropriate wall thickness
2. **Thermal break construction** for energy efficiency
3. **Proper glass configuration** with LOW-E coating
4. **Quality hardware** from established brands
5. **Appropriate surface coating** for Philippine climate

**Success Strategy:**
- Prepare complete technical specifications before contacting suppliers
- Ask specific technical questions and verify answers
- Compare quotes on identical specifications only
- Plan for total delivered cost, not just product pricing
- Allow adequate time for specification and quality verification

Note: Make sure the installers ACTUALLY use Stainless Steel screws & fixings!! Inspect them before they use them.

The lowest quote rarely delivers the best value. Focus on suppliers who demonstrate technical knowledge and provide complete, accurate specifications.
