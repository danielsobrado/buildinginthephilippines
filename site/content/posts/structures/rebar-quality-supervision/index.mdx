# What to Check for Quality Rebar and Concrete Construction

## **REBAR (Steel Reinforcement) - What You Need to Watch**

### **When Rebar Arrives**
- [ ] **Check certificates**: Ask for papers showing the steel meets quality standards
- [ ] **Look for rust**: Light surface rust is OK, but heavy flaking rust is not acceptable
- [ ] **Verify sizes**: Make sure the rebar thickness matches your drawings
- [ ] **Count quantities**: Check delivery receipts match what you ordered
- [ ] **Check markings**: Good rebar has manufacturer marks stamped on it

### **Storage and Handling**
- [ ] **Keep it off the ground**: Rebar should be stored on wooden blocks or concrete, never directly on soil
- [ ] **Separate different sizes**: Don't mix different rebar diameters in the same pile
- [ ] **Cover from rain**: Use tarps to protect from heavy rain and moisture
- [ ] **Keep it organized**: Easy to identify and access different sizes when needed
- [ ] **Clean before use**: Remove any loose rust, mud, or oil before installation

### **During Installation**
- [ ] **Check spacing**: Rebar should be evenly spaced as shown in drawings
- [ ] **Verify cover**: Rebar should have proper concrete cover (usually 25-40mm from surface)
- [ ] **Secure tying**: Rebar should be tied together properly so it doesn't move during concrete pour
- [ ] **No bending on site**: Don't allow workers to bend rebar with torches or improper tools
- [ ] **Check connections**: Where rebar pieces overlap, they should overlap enough length (usually 40-60 times the bar diameter)

### **Critical Things to Stop Work For**
- [ ] **Corroded rebar**: If rust flakes off easily or reduces bar size
- [ ] **Wrong spacing**: If rebar is significantly off from drawings
- [ ] **Insufficient cover**: If rebar is too close to concrete surface
- [ ] **Poor connections**: If overlaps are too short or not properly tied

## **CONCRETE - What You Need to Watch**

### **Before Concrete Arrives**
- [ ] **Weather check**: Don't pour in heavy rain or extreme heat (above 35°C)
- [ ] **Forms ready**: All wooden forms or molds should be clean, oiled, and properly braced
- [ ] **Rebar approved**: Steel reinforcement should be inspected and approved first
- [ ] **Access ready**: Clear path for concrete trucks and pumps
- [ ] **Tools ready**: Vibrators, floats, and finishing tools should be clean and working

### **When Concrete Trucks Arrive**
- [ ] **Check delivery time**: Concrete should be used within 90 minutes of mixing
- [ ] **Look at consistency**: Concrete should look uniform, not separated or too watery
- [ ] **Ask for slump test**: Simple test shows if concrete has right consistency (usually 75-125mm)
- [ ] **Check quantity**: Verify cubic meters delivered matches what you ordered
- [ ] **Temperature check**: Concrete should not be too hot (below 32°C)

### **During Concrete Pour**
- [ ] **Pour continuously**: Don't stop pouring for long periods - creates weak spots
- [ ] **Use vibrators**: Workers should use vibrators to remove air bubbles
- [ ] **Don't add water**: Never allow workers to add extra water to make concrete easier to work
- [ ] **Proper placement**: Pour concrete in layers, don't dump from high places
- [ ] **Take test samples**: Make concrete cylinders for strength testing (at least 2 per day or per 25 cubic meters)

### **Quality Tests You Must Do**
- [ ] **Slump test**: Every truck load - checks consistency
- [ ] **Cylinder samples**: At least 2 samples per pour day for strength testing
- [ ] **7-day strength**: Test cylinders after 7 days for early strength indication
- [ ] **28-day strength**: Final strength test - must meet design requirements

### **After Concrete is Poured**
- [ ] **Start curing immediately**: Keep concrete moist for at least 7 days
- [ ] **Cover and protect**: Use plastic sheets or wet burlap to retain moisture
- [ ] **No heavy loads**: Don't allow construction equipment on new concrete for at least 7 days
- [ ] **Monitor temperature**: Protect from direct sun and maintain moisture
- [ ] **Remove forms carefully**: Wait for proper strength before removing wooden forms

### **Critical Things to Stop Work For**
- [ ] **Segregated concrete**: If you see just rocks and water, no cement paste
- [ ] **Too much water added**: If workers add water to make concrete "easier"
- [ ] **No vibration**: If workers don't use vibrators to consolidate concrete
- [ ] **Poor weather**: Rain during pour or extreme temperatures
- [ ] **Late delivery**: Concrete arriving more than 90 minutes after mixing

## **STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION**

### **Site Management**
- [ ] **Clean work area**: Keep construction area clean and organized
- [ ] **Material separation**: Keep different materials in clearly marked areas
- [ ] **Weather protection**: Adequate covered storage for cement and materials
- [ ] **Access control**: Restrict unauthorized personnel from work areas
- [ ] **Tool maintenance**: Ensure all equipment is properly maintained

### **Documentation You Need**
- [ ] **Material certificates**: Keep all quality certificates from suppliers
- [ ] **Delivery receipts**: Record of all materials delivered with dates and quantities
- [ ] **Test results**: All concrete strength test results
- [ ] **Daily reports**: Simple daily log of work progress and any issues
- [ ] **Photos**: Take photos of critical stages (rebar placement, concrete pour, etc.)

## **SAFETY BASICS**

### **Worker Safety**
- [ ] **Hard hats required**: All workers must wear safety helmets
- [ ] **Safety shoes**: Steel-toed boots for all workers
- [ ] **Gloves for concrete**: Chemical-resistant gloves when handling concrete
- [ ] **Eye protection**: Safety glasses when cutting or grinding
- [ ] **First aid kit**: Available on site with emergency contact numbers

### **Equipment Safety**
- [ ] **Electrical safety**: All electrical equipment properly grounded
- [ ] **Machine guards**: All rotating equipment has proper guards
- [ ] **Lifting equipment**: Cranes and hoists regularly inspected
- [ ] **Fall protection**: Guardrails or safety harnesses for work above 2 meters

## **RED FLAGS - When to Stop Work Immediately**

1. **Workers adding water to concrete** after it arrives
2. **Rusted rebar** that flakes off when touched
3. **Concrete arriving late** (more than 90 minutes old)
4. **No vibration** during concrete placement
5. **Working in heavy rain** or extreme heat
6. **Unsafe working conditions** or workers without proper safety equipment
7. **Materials stored improperly** (cement bags wet, rebar on ground)
8. **No quality testing** being performed

## **YOUR ROLE**

### **Daily Checks**
- Walk the site daily when work is happening
- Ask to see test results and certificates
- Verify materials are stored properly
- Ensure safety equipment is being used
- Take photos of progress

### **Weekly Reviews**
- Review test results with your engineer
- Check project progress against schedule
- Verify all documentation is being maintained
- Discuss any concerns with contractor

### **Key Questions to Ask**
1. "Can I see today's slump test results?"
2. "Where are the material certificates?"
3. "When will these concrete cylinders be tested?"
4. "Why is this rebar stored on the ground?"
5. "Is this concrete within the delivery time limit?"

**Remember: You don't need to be a technical expert, but asking the right questions and knowing what to look for will help ensure quality construction. When in doubt, consult with your structural engineer.**
