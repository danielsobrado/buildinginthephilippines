# Aluminum vs uPVC Windows in the Philippines

Filipino homeowners planning construction face a crucial decision: spend more on fluorocarbon-coated aluminum windows or save money with uPVC? After researching real market prices, talking to actual homeowners, and analyzing performance in our challenging tropical climate, the answer depends on your budget, location, and priorities. Here's the honest truth about both options.

**The bottom line upfront:** Fluorocarbon-coated aluminum costs 2-3 times more initially but lasts twice as long and performs better in extreme heat and coastal conditions. uPVC offers better energy savings and lower upfront costs but struggles with thermal expansion in our 35-40°C heat. Both work well when properly installed, but your specific situation determines which is right for you.

## The real costs in Philippine peso

Let's talk numbers because budget matters. Based on current 2025 pricing from major suppliers:

**uPVC windows cost ₱3,000-8,000 per square meter** depending on quality. A typical house might cost ₱200,000 total for all windows and doors with mid-range uPVC.

**Fluorocarbon-coated aluminum runs ₱4,680-6,790 per square meter** for standard options, with premium systems going higher. That same house would cost ₱600,000-800,000 with quality aluminum systems like Duralco.

Installation adds 20-25% to your total budget regardless of material choice. Labor rates in Metro Manila average ₱645 per day, with provincial areas 20-30% cheaper.

The sticker shock is real - aluminum costs significantly more upfront. But here's what experienced contractors told us: "Aluminum lasts 40-50 years while uPVC typically needs replacement after 20-30 years." When you factor in the longer lifespan, the cost difference narrows considerably over time.

**Major suppliers offer 10-year warranties** on both materials. Duralco, AMC Aluminum, and others have strong reputations for aluminum, while Golden Home uPVC and Accendo lead the uPVC market with nationwide distribution.

## How they handle Philippine weather

Our tropical climate tests windows like few places on earth. Here's how each material really performs:

**Heat and thermal expansion** create the biggest performance gap. When temperatures hit 35-40°C (common during summer), uPVC expands significantly. We found reports of **doors becoming impossible to open or close** during the hottest parts of the day. One homeowner measured 2.4cm of expansion on a door frame during extreme heat.

Aluminum has minimal thermal expansion and keeps working normally even at 40°C+. This alone makes it the better choice for areas with intense sun exposure.

**Humidity resistance** is excellent for both materials. Neither absorbs moisture or develops rot like wood windows. Both handle our 80%+ humidity levels without structural problems.

**Typhoon resistance** favors aluminum due to its superior strength-to-weight ratio. Modern uPVC systems can handle high winds when properly reinforced with steel inserts, but aluminum provides better peace of mind in storm-prone areas.

**Coastal conditions** strongly favor fluorocarbon-coated aluminum. The PVDF coating has been tested for 4,000+ hours in salt spray conditions and shows proven performance in Philippine coastal projects from Bataan to Cebu. uPVC doesn't corrode, but the thermal expansion issues get worse with direct coastal sun exposure.

One glass and aluminum business owner told us: "We don't carry uPVC yet because we need to see how it withstands Philippine typhoons, pollution, heat, and humidity long-term. With aluminum, we've never received complaints about rot, cracking, warping, or discoloration."

## What homeowners actually experience

Filipino homeowners on construction forums share mixed experiences with both materials.

**Aluminum reality check:** Modern aluminum profiles are thinner than the heavy-duty ones from decades past, making them "shake and noisy during strong winds" according to one contractor with 4 years of experience. However, established brands like Duralco receive consistent praise. One user noted: "Hindi maingay kapag sinasara, compare sa iba naman napansin ko maingay yung sa iba."

**uPVC experiences** vary dramatically by quality. One homeowner reported their uPVC windows turned yellow and became "very brittle" in less than three years. However, properly formulated "tropical mix" uPVC with UV stabilizers performs much better.

**Energy efficiency** creates real savings. uPVC naturally insulates better (thermal conductivity 0.14 vs aluminum's 175), potentially reducing aircon bills significantly. Since Filipino homes spend 46% of electricity on cooling, this matters for your monthly budget.

**Maintenance** is minimal for both when quality materials are used. Aluminum needs occasional cleaning and freshwater rinsing in coastal areas. uPVC requires simple soap and water cleaning 2-3 times yearly.

## The long-term investment picture

**Durability** strongly favors aluminum with a 40-50 year lifespan versus 20-30 years for uPVC. Quality aluminum windows installed in the 1990s are still functioning well today. uPVC's long-term performance in our extreme climate remains somewhat unproven.

**Replacement costs** become significant over time. If you choose uPVC and need to replace it once during 30 years of homeownership, the total cost approaches aluminum's initial investment.

**Energy savings** from uPVC can offset some cost differences. Better insulation means lower electricity bills, potentially saving thousands annually in air-conditioned homes.

**Resale value** benefits from quality aluminum windows, which are viewed as premium features by buyers.

## When to choose aluminum

Choose fluorocarbon-coated aluminum if you:
- Live in coastal areas (salt spray, intense sun)
- Experience extreme heat regularly (35-40°C common)
- Want a one-time investment lasting 40+ years  
- Face frequent typhoons
- Prefer modern aesthetics with narrow frames
- Can afford the higher upfront cost

Aluminum makes particular sense in areas like coastal Batangas, Bataan, Cebu, or anywhere with intense sun exposure. The thermal expansion advantage alone justifies the cost in these conditions.

## When to choose uPVC

Choose quality uPVC if you:
- Have budget constraints but want good performance
- Prioritize energy efficiency and lower aircon bills
- Live inland with moderate temperatures
- Want excellent sound insulation
- Prefer traditional window aesthetics
- Plan shorter-term homeownership (10-20 years)

uPVC works well in air-conditioned environments and areas with less extreme heat exposure. Choose lighter colors and ensure proper installation with expansion accommodation.

## Practical tips for both options

**For aluminum buyers:**
- Insist on AAMA 2605 certified fluorocarbon coating
- Consider thermal break technology for better energy efficiency
- Use established suppliers like Duralco, AMC Aluminum, or APRO
- Budget 20-30% more for thermal break systems
- Ensure proper installation with experienced contractors

**For uPVC buyers:**
- Specify UV-resistant "tropical mix" formulation
- Choose light colors to minimize heat absorption
- Verify steel reinforcement in frame construction
- Allow for thermal expansion during installation
- Select suppliers with proven Philippine track records

**Universal advice:**
- Installation quality matters more than material choice
- Get multiple quotes from established suppliers
- Verify warranty terms and local service availability
- Consider your specific climate exposure (coastal vs inland)
- Factor long-term costs, not just initial price

## The honest verdict

Both materials work in the Philippines when properly specified and installed. **Fluorocarbon-coated aluminum is the premium choice**; more expensive upfront but superior performance in our challenging climate and longer lifespan. **uPVC offers better value for budget-conscious homeowners** willing to accept some limitations in extreme heat.

Your decision should prioritize your specific conditions. Coastal homes, areas with extreme heat, and long-term investments favor aluminum. Budget-conscious buyers in moderate climates can choose quality uPVC with confidence.

Don't let suppliers oversell you, but don't go too cheap either. Both materials have quality ranges, and the difference between good and poor products is dramatic. Focus on reputable suppliers, proper installation, and matching the material to your specific needs and climate conditions.

The most expensive mistake isn't choosing the wrong material. It's about choosing poor quality products or installation that fail prematurely. Invest in quality regardless of which path you choose.
