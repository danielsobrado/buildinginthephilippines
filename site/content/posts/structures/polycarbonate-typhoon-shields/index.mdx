# Clear Shields Against Category 5: The Truth About Polycarbonate Typhoon Protection

Your contractor just quoted ₱500,000 for aluminum storm shutters, or you're staring at another ₱50,000 plywood budget for the next typhoon. Meanwhile, Florida homeowners have been using clear polycarbonate shields for decades, lightweight panels that let light through while stopping a 9-pound 2×4 fired at 34 mph. After researching actual test data and Philippine availability, here's what you need to know about this typhoon protection method.

**The reality:** Polycarbonate shields work brilliantly for typhoon protection when properly installed, cost less than aluminum shutters over time, and can be a DIY project. But thickness matters, mounting is critical, and not all "polycarbonate" is created equal.

## What Makes Polycarbonate Different

### The Material Science

Polycarbonate isn't just "plastic sheeting" – it's the same material used in:
- **Bullet-resistant glass** (banks, embassies)
- **Fighter jet canopies** (impact at 500+ mph)
- **Riot shields** (police/military grade)
- **Safety glasses** (ANSI Z87.1 rated)

**Key Properties:**
- **Impact strength**: 250× stronger than glass
- **Weight**: 50% lighter than glass, 80% lighter than plywood
- **Transparency**: 88% light transmission (clear versions)
- **Temperature range**: -40°C to +120°C operation
- **UV resistance**: 10+ years with proper coating

### Proven Hurricane Performance

**Miami-Dade Large Missile Test (TAS 201-94):**
- Test projectile: 9 lb (4.1 kg) 2×4 lumber
- Impact velocity: 50 ft/sec (34 mph / 55 km/h)
- **Result**: 16mm multi-wall polycarbonate – NO PENETRATION
- **Result**: 12mm solid polycarbonate – NO PENETRATION
- **Result**: 3/4" plywood – PENETRATED

**Wind Pressure Testing (ASTM E1996):**
- Tested pressure: ±170 mph (273 km/h) equivalent
- Cyclic loading: 9,000 positive/negative cycles
- **Result**: No failure, no permanent deformation

- **Added benefit**: No storage rot, no termites, reusable indefinitely

## Installation Methods That Actually Work

### Fixed Mounting Points (Recommended)

![Polycarbonate panels being installed on a house for typhoon protection](./polycarbonate-installation.jpg)

**Step 1: Install Permanent Anchors**
- Drill into concrete/masonry every 30cm around opening
- Use 10mm stainless expansion anchors
- Leave 25mm thread exposed
- Cap with plastic covers when not in use

**Step 2: Panel Preparation**
- Cut panels 10cm larger than opening on all sides
- Drill 12mm holes matching anchor positions
- Use rubber washers on both sides
- Label each panel for specific openings

**Step 3: Storm Deployment**
- Remove anchor caps (5 minutes)
- Position panel over opening
- Install washers and wing nuts
- Tighten evenly to compress gaskets
- **Total installation time**: 15 minutes per opening

### Track System (Professional)

**Horizontal U-Channels:**
- Permanent top/bottom aluminum tracks
- Panels slide in from side
- Secured with end stops or bolts
- **Advantage**: Faster deployment
- **Disadvantage**: Higher initial cost, visible year-round

### Direct Screw Mount (Emergency Only)

For immediate protection without pre-planning:
- Screw directly through panel into wall
- Use minimum 75mm stainless screws
- Space every 20cm along edges
- **Problems**: Damages wall, takes longer, less secure

## Critical Installation Details

### Panel Overlap Requirements

**Minimum Edge Coverage:**
- **Top/Bottom**: 10cm beyond glass
- **Sides**: 10cm beyond glass
- **Corner reinforcement**: 15cm from corner
- **Maximum unsupported span**: 2.0m

### Multi-Panel Configuration for Large Openings

**4.5m × 2.5m Curtain Wall Example:**
```
Panel Layout:
[Panel 1: 1.6m] [H-Channel] [Panel 2: 1.6m] [H-Channel] [Panel 3: 1.6m]
                     |                |                |
               Support Post      Support Post    Support Post
```

**Benefits:**
- Easier handling (30kg vs 90kg single sheet)
- Reduced wind load per panel
- Simpler storage
- Lower replacement cost if damaged

### Wind Load Calculations

**Basic Formula:**
Wind Pressure = 0.00256 × V² (V in km/h, result in Pa)

**Super Typhoon Odette (260 km/h gusts):**
- Pressure = 0.00256 × 260² = **1,730 Pa**
- Safety factor 1.5× = **2,595 Pa required**
- 16mm polycarbonate rating: **4,000+ Pa** ✓

- **Right**: Every 30cm for panels over 2m²

**Missing Middle Support:**
- **Wrong**: 3m unsupported span
- **Right**: H-channel or support post at 2m maximum

### Material Selection Mistakes

**Using Acrylic Instead:**
- Acrylic shatters on impact
- 30× weaker than polycarbonate
- Often mislabeled as "crystal polycarbonate"

**Greenhouse Panels:**
- Usually only 4-6mm thick
- Not impact-tested
- Inadequate UV protection

**Recycled/Reclaimed Sheets:**
- Unknown UV exposure history
- Potential stress cracks
- No warranty

## The Bottom Line

Polycarbonate typhoon shields represent the best balance of protection, cost, and practicality for Philippine coastal homes. At roughly ₱2,500-3,500 per square meter installed, they cost 40% less than aluminum shutters while providing equal protection and the advantage of transparency.

**For Typhoon-Prone Areas:**
- **Best Value**: 16mm multi-wall polycarbonate with permanent anchor system
- **Budget Option**: 12mm solid sheets for smaller openings only
- **Premium Choice**: Factory-made panel systems with tracks

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. Buy genuine polycarbonate (not acrylic or "PC-like")
2. Minimum 12mm thickness for windows, 16mm for doors
3. Install anchors into structure, not just render
4. Practice installation before typhoon season
5. Store properly between uses

**Cost Comparison Over 10 Years:**
- Polycarbonate shields: ₱30,000 (one-time)
- Plywood (5 typhoons): ₱25,000 + labor
- Do nothing (1 window failure): ₱50,000-200,000 damage

The evidence is clear: polycarbonate shields work, they're affordable, and they can be installed by competent DIYers. They won't yellow or fail if you buy quality material with UV protection. Most importantly, they let you see the storm outside while keeping it there.
