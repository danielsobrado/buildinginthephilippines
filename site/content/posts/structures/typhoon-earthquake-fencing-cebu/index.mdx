# Perimeter Fencing That Won't Collapse During the Next Typhoon

Hey, Daniel here!

So you need to build a fence in Cebu and you're worried about typhoons. And earthquakes. And basically everything that nature throws at the Visayas every year. welcome to the club.

I spent way too much time researching this because contractors kept giving me wildly different advice. One guy swore by regular hollow blocks, another wanted to sell me some expensive precast system. So I dug into the actual specs.

Here's what I found.

## The Problem with Regular CHB Fences

Most perimeter walls in the Philippines use concrete hollow blocks. Standard CHBs have compressive strength around 350-500 PSI. That sounds fine until you realize load-bearing blocks rated for actual structural use are 700-1000 PSI.

Big difference.

Regular CHBs crack under lateral forces. Wind pushes on your 2 meter fence? The blocks themselves might be okay but the wall fails at the joints. Seen it happen during Odette.

## High-Strength CHB Options

ok so here's what actually works for typhoon areas:

### Load-Bearing CHBs (700-1000 PSI)

These are the heavy duty ones. JackBilt makes blocks rated at 700 PSI and 1000 PSI that meet ASTM C90 standards. They come in:
- 4 inch thick
- 5 inch thick  
- 6 inch thick

The 6" ones are what you want for perimeter walls. They have lower water absorption too which matters in coastal areas.

**Where to buy in Cebu:**
- RGP Enterprises in Consolacion has load-bearing CHBs up to 1000 PSI
- Check construction depots, they usually sell by pallet or truckload
- Prices higher than regular blocks but worth it

One thing contractors dont always tell you - the blocks alone aren't enough. You need:
- Vertical rebar in the hollow cores
- Grout filling
- Reinforced concrete posts every 2-3 meters

That last part is super important. The RC posts handle the flexural strength when wind or quakes hit.

## Precast Concrete Panel Options

Now here's where it gets interesting. There's actual precast systems made in Cebu that might be better than CHB for certain situations.

### Greenlink Z-Panels

These are structural precast panels from Greenlink Solutions in Mandaue. Here's the crazy part - they're rated at 5,000 PSI. 

Yeah. Five thousand.

Compare that to 700-1000 PSI for good CHBs.

The Z-Panels are steel-reinforced, designed specifically for typhoon and earthquake areas. They used them for a 5-storey building in downtown Cebu which tells you something about the strength. For a fence they're honestly overkill but if you want zero worry, there you go.

### FahstWall Panels

These are different - lightweight panels made in Tingub, Mandaue. Each panel is 2 ft x 8 ft and covers about 1.5 square meters (equivalent to 18 CHB units).

The specs:
- 75mm thick (about 3 inches)
- 65-70% lighter than equivalent CHB wall
- Tongue-and-groove edges with special adhesive
- Composite of fiber-reinforced concrete with EPS infill

Here's why lightweight matters - during earthquakes, lighter walls have lower inertial forces. Less mass = less energy = less chance of collapse.

FahstWall claims their panels survived Typhoon Odette in 2021 with minimal damage. I haven't verified this myself but it's worth asking them about.

Other features:
- Up to 5-hour fire rating
- Water resistant
- Paint-ready finish, no plastering needed
- Installs 8-10x faster than CHB masonry

The compressive strength is lower, around 350-600 PSI, but because it's a continuous panel with fiber reinforcement it performs differently than individual blocks. Still, for very high fences in exposed locations I'd probably go with higher strength options.

### AAC/ALC Panels (Luftcrete)

Autoclaved Lightweight Concrete panels from Luftcrete Philippines in Pagsabungan, Mandaue. These are made with cement, lime, gypsum, sand and aluminum powder, cured in high-pressure autoclaves.

Specs are around 600-700 PSI but with steel reinforcement integrated. The manufacturer claims "3x stronger than conventional panels" though I'm not sure what they're comparing to exactly.

Benefits:
- No plastering required
- Fireproof
- Water resistant
- Termite proof

Good middle ground option if you want something between heavy structural panels and basic CHB.

## What Should You Actually Use?

Depends on your situation. Here's my rough guide:

**For a standard residential fence (1.5-2m high):**
- 6" high-PSI CHBs (700+ PSI) with RC posts every 2.5m
- Proper rebar and grout filling
- This is the most cost-effective option for most people

**For tall fences (2.5m+) or very exposed locations:**
- Consider precast panels, either Z-Panels or the post-and-panel systems
- More expensive but less labor intensive
- Better engineered for lateral loads

**For quick construction or seismic concerns:**
- FahstWall or similar lightweight panels
- Lower weight = better earthquake performance
- Much faster installation

**For maximum strength and budget isn't the main issue:**
- Greenlink Z-Panels at 5000 PSI
- Basically overkill for fences but they work

## Suppliers Summary (Cebu)

Throwing this together since I keep forgetting where to find stuff:

| Product | Location | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| High-PSI CHBs | RGP Enterprises, Consolacion | Up to 1000 PSI |
| Z-Panels | Greenlink Solutions, Mandaue | 5000 PSI structural |
| FahstWall | Tingub, Mandaue | Lightweight panels |
| Luftcrete AAC | Pagsabungan, Mandaue | Autoclaved panels |

btw prices change constantly so call ahead. And delivery fees can be brutal depending on where you're building.

## Don't Forget the Foundation

whatever you choose, the foundation matters just as much as the wall material. Common mistake is using fancy blocks on a weak footing.

For fence foundations in typhoon areas:
- Minimum 0.3m depth, more if soil is soft
- Continuous strip footing or individual post footings
- Proper drainage so water doesnt pool against the wall

A contractor once tried to convince me to skip the continuous footing because "it's just a fence." No thanks.

## What About Green Fences? (Madre de Cacao etc.)

ok so someone asked me about this recently. If you're doing a GI post + cyclone wire fence, should you add a living hedge like Madre de Cacao?

Short answer: yes, but don't plant it wrong or you'll regret it.

### Why a Green Fence Makes Sense

Especially for coastal areas like Camotes or anywhere near the sea:

- **Privacy** - cyclone wire + barbed is ugly and see-through. A hedge will visually block in 2-3 years
- **Backup security** - when the cyclone wire rusts in 10-15 years (and it will), the hedge is already woody and dense. Nobody wants to push through that
- **Wind and dust filter** - on islands with constant sea breeze, a hedge softens wind and catches salt/dust before it hits your house
- **Cost** - Madre de Cacao (kakawate) cuttings are basically free. Most cost is labor

The concept is: steel fence for now, green fence for the long term. Makes sense.

### The Big Mistake: Planting Between the Wires

Here's where people screw up. They plant the hedge literally inside the fence line, tangled through the cyclone mesh and wires.

Don't do this.

Problems:
1. **Accelerates rust** - leaves, moisture, and soil get trapped against the cyclone mesh. Salt + constant damp foliage = faster corrosion on everything
2. **Maintenance nightmare** - try re-tensioning or replacing cyclone wire with tree trunks threaded through it. Any repair means cutting plants or wire
3. **Deforms the fence** - thick branches push the mesh and posts, making everything wavey. Roots near post footings can crack weak concrete too

### The Right Way to Do It

Think in two separate lines:

**Line 1 - Structural fence (on your boundary)**
- CHB base or concrete footings
- GI posts every 3m
- Cyclone mesh + barbed wire on top
- This sits exactly on your property line

**Line 2 - Green fence (inside your lot)**
- Plant Madre de Cacao 30-60 cm inside your side of the fence
- Keep a maintenance strip between mesh and plants so you can walk along it, paint posts, fix mesh later

From outside looking in:
```
[Road/Neighbor] → Cyclone fence → 30-60cm gap → Hedge → Your lot
```

This gives you:
- Protection for the steel (hedge filters wind/salt but doesn't touch mesh)
- You can actually work on the posts without killing plants
- No branches crossing over to neighbor's side

### Planting Numbers

For a long fence line, here's rough math:

| Spacing | Plants per 100m |
|---------|-----------------|
| 0.5m (tight hedge) | ~200 plants |
| 0.75m (normal) | ~133 plants |

So for like 240m of fence you're looking at 320-480 plants depending on how dense you want it.

**Tips:**
- Madre de Cacao as main "framework" plant
- Mix in some denser shrubs for year-round coverage (Madre goes semi-deciduous in dry season)
- Keep at least 30-40cm from CHB base or post footings
- First 1-2 years: keep them clipped to branch out, don't let them shoot straight up
- Long term: maintain 0.6-1m thickness, 2-3m height
- Trim so it leans inward on your side, not over the fence

## The Real Answer

Look, every LGU has different requirements and every site has different conditions. Soil type, wind exposure, budget, height requirements - all that matters.

What I can tell you is that standard 350-500 PSI CHBs are not enough for serious typhoon areas. Either upgrade to 700+ PSI blocks with proper reinforcement, or look at the precast options.

The extra cost upfront beats rebuilding after every big storm.

anyway, that's what I found. Prices and availability from late 2024 / early 2025, your mileage may vary. Good luck with your fence.
