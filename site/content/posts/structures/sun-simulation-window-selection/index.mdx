# Using Sun Simulation Videos to Choose the Right Window Glass - LOW-E, Thermal Break, and Tinting Decisions

Your architect hands you a 3D sun simulation video showing shadows dancing across your future home throughout the day and seasons. It looks impressive, but how do you actually use this data to make smart decisions about LOW-E coatings, thermal breaks, and glass tinting? Most homeowners get these expensive simulations, nod appreciatively, then still guess on window specifications.

**Bottom line upfront:** Sun simulation videos reveal the precise solar gain patterns that determine which windows need premium LOW-E coatings, where thermal breaks matter most, and whether tinting is worth the cost. Used correctly, these simulations can save you ₱100,000-300,000 in unnecessary upgrades while ensuring comfort where it matters.

Here's how to translate pretty animations into practical window specifications that work.

*3D sun simulation showing seasonal shadow patterns and solar exposure analysis throughout different times of day and year*

The video above demonstrates a comprehensive sun study analysis showing:
- **Front and back elevations** with seasonal sun position changes
- **Summer vs winter sun angles** affecting different window orientations  
- **Daily shadow progression** from sunrise to sunset
- **Thermal load visualization** indicating peak solar gain periods

Your architect's simulation captures four key seasonal scenarios: front view summer sun, back view summer sun, front view winter sun, and back view winter sun. Each scenario reveals critical data for window specification decisions.

## What Your Sun Simulation Actually Shows

Your architect's 3D model tracks the sun's path across your building envelope, showing exact shadow patterns, direct solar exposure, and thermal loads on each surface. But the key insights aren't obvious from just watching the video.

**Critical data points in the simulation:**
- **Direct solar exposure hours** per window orientation
- **Seasonal variation** in sun angles and intensity  
- **Shadow protection** from overhangs, neighboring buildings, landscaping
- **Thermal load timing** - when each window receives maximum heat gain
- **Glare patterns** throughout different times of day

**What the video reveals that specifications must address:**
- West-facing windows getting hammered by afternoon sun (need maximum LOW-E protection)
- North windows with minimal direct exposure (standard glass acceptable)
- East windows with morning sun but afternoon shade (moderate LOW-E sufficient)
- South windows with seasonal variation (thermal break critical for year-round comfort)

The simulation shows you where to invest in premium glass technologies and where standard specifications work fine.

## Decoding Solar Exposure Patterns for Glass Selection
