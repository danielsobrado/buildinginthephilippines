# The Reality of Getting Aluminum Windows and Doors Quotes in the Philippines

After dealing with multiple suppliers and comparing three different quotations for the same project, here's what you actually need to know about getting aluminum windows and doors quotes. Most advice online glosses over the real complexity - this won't.

## The Quote Confusion: What You're Actually Comparing

**Not all aluminum series are the same.** Suppliers will quote you different series without explaining the differences, making price comparisons meaningless.

From my quotations:
- **125-70 Series**: Standard thermal break, 1.5mm thickness
- **110 Ultra-Narrow Series**: Thicker profiles (1.8mm), minimal visible frames
- **116-76 Series**: Heavy-duty for doors, 2.5mm thickness

The price difference? Ultra-narrow series runs about 15-20% more, but the visual impact is significant. Wide frames make your house look dated before you finish building, if that is important to you.

## Glass Specifications: Where They Hide Costs

### The Marketing vs Reality

Suppliers love throwing around terms like "triple layer tempered glass" and "LOW-E coating." Here's what actually matters:

**Glass Configuration That Works:**
- 5mm clear glass + 1.14PVB + 5mm clear glass + 12A Argon gas + 5mm LOW-E clear glass
- Total: Triple layers with proper insulation

**What Changes Your Quote:**
- **PVB thickness**: 0.76mm vs 1.14mm affects safety and price
- **Argon spacing**: 12A, 19A, 20A, or 25A affects insulation
- **LOW-E coating**: Mandatory for energy efficiency, standard on quality windows

The difference between basic and premium glass configuration can add $50-100 per square meter.

## Hardware Quality: The Hidden Cost Multiplier

### Brand Hierarchy (From My Quotes)
1. **CHINA Brand** - Basic, functional, budget option
2. **KINLONG Brand** - Mid-range, reliable
3. **HOPO Brand** - Premium, heavy-duty (used on sliding doors)

**Reality Check**: Hardware determines how your windows operate daily. Cheap hardware means sticky operations, adjustment issues, and early failures.

For sliding screens:
- **Diamond mesh (0.8mm)**: Standard for windows
- **HD Mesh Screen**: Premium for doors
- **Fly Screen (nylon)**: Basic for awning windows

## Coating Types: The Durability Decision

### Fluorocarbon vs Powder Coating

From supplier discussions:
- **Fluorocarbon coating**: Premium, weather-resistant, maintains color
- **Powder coating**: Standard, various colors available, less durable

The price difference is minimal ($20-30 per window), but durability difference is significant. In Philippine weather, fluorocarbon coating prevents color fading and chalking.

**Color Options Available**: The suppliers showed the same color chart - brown wood, golden yellow, red wood, white, gray, champagne, chocolate, pure white, matte gray, matte black.

## Series Comparison: What The Numbers Actually Mean

### Frame Visibility Impact
- **Standard Series**: Thicker frames, visible structure, traditional look
- **Ultra-Narrow Series**: Minimal frame visibility, modern aesthetic, maximum glass area

### Strength vs Aesthetics
- **125-70 Series** (1.5mm): Standard residential, good for most applications
- **110 Ultra-Narrow** (1.8mm): Premium residential, better strength-to-visibility ratio  
- **116-76 Series** (2.5mm): Heavy-duty for large doors and commercial applications

## Quotation Red Flags I Encountered

### Process Issues
1. **Suppliers who can't provide complete quotes** - One supplier needed multiple follow-ups for missing door schedules
2. **Mixing standard and premium without explanation** - Same supplier quoted different glass thicknesses without noting the change
3. **Hardware brand switching** - Different brands for different products without price justification

### Price Structure Problems
1. **No clear series differentiation** - Quotes that don't specify which aluminum series
2. **Glass specification vagueness** - "Triple tempered glass" without PVB and spacer details
3. **Missing installation scope** - EXW pricing without local handling costs

## What Actually Affects Your Final Cost

### Size vs Complexity
From the quotes, cost per square meter varies dramatically:
- **Small windows** (1.1-2.4 sqm): $271-621 per sqm
- **Large windows** (8.5-11.5 sqm): $108-165 per sqm  
- **Sliding doors**: $303-333 per sqm

**Why?** Fixed costs (hardware, frames, manufacturing setup) spread across larger areas.

### Configuration Impact
- **Fixed windows**: Cheapest per sqm (no hardware)
- **Sliding windows**: Mid-range pricing
- **Awning windows**: Premium due to hardware complexity
- **Sliding doors**: Highest absolute cost due to size and heavy-duty requirements

## The Real Delivery Timeline

**Standard Promise**: 30 days after deposit
**Reality**: Add buffer time for:
- Architectural drawing approvals
- Color confirmations  
- Hardware specification finalization
- Shipping delays (especially for custom sizes)

One supplier revised quotes three times during our process. Plan accordingly.

## EXW vs Delivered Pricing

**EXW (Ex Works)** means you handle:
- Shipping from factory to port
- Import duties and taxes
- Local transportation
- Unloading and installation

From quotes: Additional costs include $1,074-1,146 for plywood box packing, plus all logistics.

## Practical Buying Strategy

### Before Requesting Quotes
1. **Complete architectural drawings** - Suppliers can't quote accurately from sketches
2. **Decide on series preference** - Standard vs ultra-narrow affects entire quote structure
3. **Color selection** - Some colors may have longer lead times

### When Comparing Quotes
1. **Verify aluminum series consistency** across all suppliers
2. **Check glass specifications match** - PVB thickness, spacer size, LOW-E coating
3. **Confirm hardware brands** - Don't accept "equivalent" substitutions
4. **Compare coating types** - Fluorocarbon vs powder pricing

### Red Flag Questions
- "Can you specify the exact aluminum series for each product?"
- "What's the PVB thickness and argon spacer size?"
- "Which hardware brand for each window type?"

If they can't answer specifically, find another supplier. Is your supplier a middle man? Or is he manufacturing?

## The Bottom Line

Aluminum window and door quotes are complex because every component affects cost and performance. Suppliers who oversimplify are either hiding something or don't understand their own products.

**Focus on:**
1. **Consistent aluminum series** 
2. **Proper glass configuration** (5+1.14PVB+5+12A+5 LOW-E minimum)
3. **Quality hardware brands** (KINLONG or better)
4. **Fluorocarbon coating** for durability, see the article on fluorocarbon vs powder coating if you are near the coast
5. **Complete scope definition** including installation

**Price Reality**: Budget $200-400 per square meter for quality windows delivered and installed. Doors run $300-500 per square meter depending on size and complexity.

The cheapest quote will likely become the most expensive mistake. Focus on finding suppliers who can explain their specifications clearly and provide consistent, detailed quotes.
