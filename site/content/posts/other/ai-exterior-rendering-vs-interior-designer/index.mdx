## Why I Started Testing AI for Exterior Design

When I started planning the exterior design for my house, I got several quotations from interior designers. The prices were high, thousands of dollars just for basic design concepts and renderings. For someone building in the Philippines where every peso counts, I knew there had to be a better way.

That's when I decided to experiment with AI rendering tools instead of paying big bucks for an interior designer. The results have been surprisingly good, and I'm having fun while saving serious money.

## My AI Rendering Toolkit

### Sora - The Main Powerhouse 

For the heavy lifting, I use [Sora](https://sora.chatgpt.com), which comes included with ChatGPT Plus for $20/month. This tool is incredible for generating different exterior design variations. I can upload my base house design and ask Sora to render it with different materials, lighting conditions, and architectural styles.

The quality is remarkably photorealistic. I can get:
- Different time-of-day renderings (golden hour, daylight, twilight)
- Various material options (wood siding, stone, stucco, modern concrete)
- Different landscape and driveway configurations
- Seasonal variations with different vegetation

### Nano Banana - For Fine-Tuning

For smaller adjustments and tweaks, I use [Nano Banana](https://aistudio.google.com/), which is currently free. This tool is perfect for making subtle changes without regenerating the entire scene. I can adjust the "temperature" setting to make it less imaginative and more faithful to my original design.

## The Process That Works

I start with a basic architectural drawing or photo of my house structure. Then I use specific prompts to guide the AI toward different design directions:

### Crafting Effective Prompts

The key is being specific about what you want. Instead of saying "make it look nice," I use detailed prompts like:

- "Photorealistic architectural rendering, professional lighting setup, DAY scene showing precise fixture details"
- "Transform this two-story house exterior with industrial materials: dark metal cladding, exposed concrete panels, black steel window frames"
- "Redesign exterior with warm modern materials: natural wood siding, cream stucco walls, bronze metal accents"

![Prompt Examples](https://github.com/danielsobrado/buildinginthephilippines/blob/main/images/ClaudeSoraPrompts1.jpg?raw=true)

I've found that including technical terms like "photorealistic," "professional lighting," and specific material descriptions gives much better results than vague artistic descriptions.

## What I've Learned

### The Good
- Cost-effective: $20/month vs thousands for a designer
- Unlimited iterations: I can try dozens of variations
- Quick turnaround: Minutes instead of weeks
- Fun and interactive: It's actually enjoyable to experiment
- Educational: I'm learning about different architectural styles and materials

### The Limitations
- Not always perfect: Sometimes AI adds or changes elements unexpectedly
- Requires iteration: Good results often take several attempts
- Limited structural changes: AI works best with material and style variations
- No technical drawings: These are concept renderings, not construction documents

## Practical Tips for Better Results

1. **Start with clear base images**: The better your starting photo or drawing, the better the AI output
2. **Use specific material descriptions**: "Natural stone veneer" works better than "stone"
3. **Control the creativity**: Lower temperature settings in Nano Banana for more faithful reproductions
4. **Iterate systematically**: Make one change at a time to understand what works
5. **Save your prompts**: Keep a library of successful prompt formulas

## Credit Where Credit is Due

I have to give credit to Sameh Dabit for suggesting this AI rendering approach and for generating the flat color references that helped me get started. His insights about using AI for design visualization opened up this whole new workflow for me.

## Real-World Application

I'm not suggesting AI should completely replace professional designers, especially for complex projects. But for basic exterior design exploration and material visualization, AI tools offer incredible value. I use AI to generate ideas and explore possibilities. Then I consult with professionals for technical implementation.

This approach has helped me:
- Communicate better with contractors by showing them visual examples
- Test different material combinations before committing to purchases
- Get family buy-in on design decisions
- Understand how different elements work together visually

## The Bottom Line

For basic exterior design exploration, AI rendering tools like Sora and Nano Banana are game-changers. At $20/month, I'm getting design capabilities that would have cost thousands just a few years ago. The tools aren't perfect, but they're incredibly powerful for the price.

If you're building in the Philippines and working with a tight budget, I highly recommend experimenting with AI rendering before hiring expensive designers. You might be surprised by what you can achieve with some creativity and the right prompts.

## How Do You Handle Design?

I'm curious about your approach to exterior and interior design. Do you hire professionals, use AI tools, or rely on your own creativity? What's worked best for your budget and timeline? The design process is becoming so much more accessible with these new AI tools, and I'd love to hear about other people's experiences.

Have you tried any AI rendering tools for your construction projects? What challenges are you facing with design visualization? Let me know, write me, I'm always looking to learn from fellow builders and improve my process.
