## The Dilemma

When I bought my plot in a Philippine subdivision, I was excited to build my dream home. But then came the big question: should I save money by using an online floor plan, or invest in hiring an architect? 

## Rules

Subdivisions here come with a stack of regulations. We're talking about setbacks from property lines, maximum building heights, specific roof pitches, and more. An online plan might not fit all these rules, which could lead to problems down the line.

## Solar pannels

I'm keen on integrating solar panels and maybe some smart home features. But it's not just about adding these onto any design. The orientation of the house, the angle of the roof, and the layout all play crucial roles. An architect can ensure these technologies are seamlessly incorporated.

## Land

My plot isn't exactly flat. Plus, the utility connections—electricity, drainage, sewer—are located in certain areas. These factors significantly impact the design and construction process. 

## Personal Touch

I have a vision of a roof deck where I can enjoy sunsets. I also need to get a soil test to make sure the foundation will be solid. An architect can tailor the design to include these personal touches while ensuring everything is structurally sound.

## When Online Works

If you're lucky enough to have a large, flat piece of land with minimal restrictions, then an online plan might work for you. It can be a cost-effective option if your needs are straightforward and you're willing to adapt to the pre-designed layout.

## Conclusion

In my case, with all the specific requirements and personal preferences, hiring an architect is the smart move. 

So, whether you choose an online design or bring in a professional, I hope your building journey goes smoothly!
