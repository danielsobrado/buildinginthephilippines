# What I Learned Trying to Buy Property From a Deceased Owner in Camotes

Hey, Daniel here!

So I found what seemed like the perfect property in Camotes. Good location, reasonable price, motivated sellers. One small detail - the original owner was deceased and the heirs were selling through an extrajudicial settlement.

Should be simple right? The property had been settled for over two years. I'd read that after two years, unknown claimants can't come forward anymore. 

Turns out that's not quite how it works.

## The Two-Year Rule Everyone Gets Wrong

Ok so here's what most people think (including me, initially):

Rule 74, Section 4 of the Rules of Court says there's a two-year period after an extrajudicial settlement is published. After that window closes, buyers are protected. Unknown heirs can't pop up and take the property back.

Sounds great.

Then I did more research and found Pedrosa v. CA (2001). This Supreme Court case basically said: the two-year protection only applies to heirs who had notice or participated. If an heir was truly omitted - never knew about it, never participated - they might NOT be bound by the two-year limit.

Wait what?

### Unknown vs Omitted Heirs

This distinction matters a lot:

**Unknown heirs with notice** - they were given proper notice through publication, had opportunity to participate, chose not to. These are bound by the two-year bar.

**Omitted heirs without participation** - they were excluded from the settlement entirely, never knew about it, didn't sign anything. These may have imprescriptible rights. Meaning they can come after the property... basically forever.

The difference isn't semantic. It's the difference between secure and potentially void titles.

## My Due Diligence Process

So I haven't paid anything yet and haven't signed. Good position to be in honestly. Here's what I started doing:

### Step 1: Get the Extrajudicial Settlement Document

First thing - actually read the extrajudicial settlement. Who signed? Are all the heirs listed? Does it match what the family tells you?

The document should list:
- The deceased
- All legal heirs
- How the property was divided
- Notarization and publication details

Check the publication - was it actually published in a newspaper of general circulation for three consecutive weeks? This is required.

### Step 2: Verify All Heirs Are Accounted For

This is where it gets tricky. The settlement might list 5 heirs. But how do you know there isn't a 6th nobody mentioned?

Things that create hidden heirs:
- Previous marriages
- Illegitimate children (acknowledged or not)
- Adopted children
- Predeceased heirs with their own children

In my case, the husband of the deceased is still alive. That's actually helpful - he should have direct knowledge of all the children, any previous relationships, etc. Living spouse = someone who can actually answer questions.

### Step 3: Social Media and Online Due Diligence

This sounds weird but hear me out. Facebook in the Philippines is basically a public record at this point.

What I did:
- Search the deceased's name, the spouse's name, the children's names
- Look at tagged photos from family events - weddings, funerals, reunions
- Check who comments "RIP Mama" or "miss you Tatay" on memorial posts
- Look for family members who might not be in the settlement

You'd be surprised what you find. A family reunion photo might show 6 siblings when the settlement only lists 5. A wedding post might reveal an estranged child nobody mentioned.

Also search for:
- The family surname + location
- Names from the tax declaration history
- Previous owners if the property changed hands before

### Step 4: PSA Records Check

Get certified copies of:
- Death certificate of the deceased
- Marriage certificate (shows if there were previous marriages)
- Birth certificates of heirs if possible

The PSA now has online ordering. Takes a few weeks but worth it.

### Step 5: Talk to Neighbors and the Barangay

Neighbors know everything. Seriously.

"Oh yes, the Dela Cruz family. Didn't one of the sons move to Saudi years ago? I think he had some falling out with the family..."

That Saudi son might be an omitted heir.

Barangay captains and officials often know the family history too. They might remember a child who was given up for adoption, or an illegitimate child who visits sometimes.

### Step 6: Check Court Records

Look for any:
- Pending cases involving the property
- Previous settlement disputes
- Intestate proceedings that might have happened

This requires going to the local RTC and sometimes the Court of Appeals. Tedious but important.

## The Surviving Spouse Angle

In my situation, the husband is still alive. This changes things:

**Advantages:**
- He can personally verify all the children/heirs
- He can sign the settlement and deed of sale directly
- He should know about any illegitimate children or previous relationships
- You can ask him point blank about heir completeness

**Still be careful:**
- Spouses sometimes hide things from each other
- He might not know about children from before marriage
- Old family disputes might mean some heirs were deliberately excluded

I'm planning to have a direct conversation with him: "Are there any other children or heirs I should know about? Anyone who didn't sign the settlement?"

His reaction tells you a lot.

## What Protection Do You Actually Have?

Based on my research, here's a rough framework:

**If relying only on the extrajudicial settlement being 2+ years old: maybe 45% protected**
- Procedural compliance might be there
- Substantive verification missing
- You don't know if all heirs were included

**If you verify all heirs actually participated: maybe 75% protected**
- You've done the genealogical work
- You understand who has claims
- Settlement appears complete

**If you add insurance/indemnity/warranties: maybe 90% protected**
- Contractual protections in place
- You have recourse if problems emerge
- Title insurance where available

Nothing is 100% in Philippine property law. Accept that.

## Red Flags to Watch For

Things that should make you nervous:

- Family members who "don't want to be involved" but didn't sign waivers
- Heirs living abroad who allegedly "gave verbal permission"
- Settlement done suspiciously fast after death
- Only some siblings signing, others represented by SPA from years ago
- Neighbors mentioning family members you haven't heard about
- The property changing hands multiple times quickly after settlement

## What I'm Actually Going to Do

Since I haven't paid or signed yet, my plan:

1. **Meet with the surviving spouse directly** - get his account of all heirs
2. **Cross-reference with social media** - verify the family tree
3. **Get PSA records** - confirm the official documentation
4. **Talk to neighbors** - informal verification
5. **Require warranties in the contract** - sellers warrant no other heirs exist, with indemnity if they're wrong
6. **Consider title insurance** - if available for this property type
7. **Escrow arrangement** - don't release full payment until title transfer completes

The extra due diligence costs time and money. But it's nothing compared to losing the property to an omitted heir five years from now.

## The Brutal Truth About Philippine Inheritance Law

Look, the legal system here intentionally protects heir rights - even at the expense of transactional certainty. That's a policy choice. You can argue about whether it's good or bad, but it's reality.

The two-year rule from Rule 74 isn't a magic bullet. It's one layer of protection among several you need.

What actually protects you:
- Proving no heirs were omitted (positive verification)
- Getting warranties and indemnities (contractual protection)
- Having all heirs sign directly (not through old SPAs)
- Documented due diligence (defense if challenged)

What doesn't fully protect you:
- Just waiting two years
- Assuming the settlement is complete because it says so
- Trusting that the family told you everyone

## Case Law You Should Know

If you're serious about this, read these:

**Pedrosa v. CA (2001)** - clarifies that omitted heirs aren't bound by the two-year period. This changed everything.

**Cruz v. Cruz** - discusses rights of pretermitted heirs

Don't rely on summaries or what people tell you these cases say. Actually read them or have a lawyer explain them properly.

## Bottom Line

Buying inherited property in the Philippines can be fine. Most transactions go through without problems. The ones that go wrong can be catastrophic - you lose the property AND the money.

The due diligence I described takes maybe 2-3 weeks of work and some fees. If the deal is worth hundreds of thousands or millions of pesos, that's nothing.

Do the work. Verify the heirs. Get it in writing.

If something feels off - if sellers are rushing you, if family members are evasive, if the story keeps changing - walk away. There's always another property.

anyway that's my experience so far. Still in the middle of it. Will update if I actually close the deal or if something goes sideways.
